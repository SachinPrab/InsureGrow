    <h1><b><u><center> What are stocks and what are the different types of stocks? </center></u></b></h1><br>
    <p align = "center"> Stocks are units of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you effectively become a part-owner of the company and are entitled to a share of its profits and assets. The value of your stock will rise or fall based on the performance of the company and the demand for its stock.

There are two main types of stocks available in the stock market: common stocks and preferred stocks.

Common stocks: Common stocks represent ownership in a company and typically give shareholders voting rights on important company decisions, such as selecting directors. The value of a common stock can go up or down depending on the company's performance, and shareholders are last in line to receive assets in the event the company is liquidated.

Preferred stocks: Preferred stocks are a type of stock that have priority over common stocks in the payment of dividends and the receipt of assets in the event the company is liquidated. Preferred stocks typically do not have voting rights and may have a fixed dividend.

In addition to these two main types of stocks, there are also different classes of stocks, such as Class A and Class B shares, which can have different voting rights and other features. It's important to carefully consider the terms of any stock you're considering buying, as the differences between classes of stock can have a significant impact on your investment
