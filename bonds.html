    Bonds, then, give you 2 potential benefits when you hold them as part of your portfolio: They give you a stream of income, and they offset some of the volatility you might see from owning stocks.<br>
<br>
If you buy a bond, you can simply collect the interest payments while waiting for the bond to reach maturity—the date the issuer has agreed to pay back the bond's face value.<br>
<br>
However, you can also buy and sell bonds on the secondary market. After bonds are initially issued, their worth will fluctuate like a stock's would. If you're holding the bond to maturity, the fluctuations won't matter—your interest payments and face value won't change.<br>
<br>
But if you buy and sell bonds, you'll need to keep in mind that the price you'll pay or receive is no longer the face value of the bond. The bond's susceptibility to changes in value is an important consideration when choosing your bonds.<br>
<br>
Bond terms to know<br>
<br>
The language of bonds can be a little confusing, and the terms that are important to know will depend on whether you're buying bonds when they're issued and holding them to maturity, or buying and selling them on the secondary market.<br>
<br>
Coupon: This is the interest rate paid by the bond. In most cases, it won't change after the bond is issued.<br>
<br>
Yield: This is a measure of interest that takes into account the bond's fluctuating changes in value. There are different ways to measure yield, but the simplest is the coupon of the bond divided by the current price.<br>
<br>
Face value: This is the amount the bond is worth when it's issued, also known as "par" value. Most bonds have a face value of $1,000.<br>
<br>
Price: This is the amount the bond would currently cost on the secondary market. Several factors play into a bond's current price, but one of the biggest is how favorable its coupon is compared with other similar bonds.<br>
<br>
Maturity & duration<br>
<br>
A bond's maturity refers to the length of time until you'll get the bond's face value back.<br>
<br>
As with any other kind of loan—like a mortgage—changes in overall interest rates will have more of an effect on bonds with longer maturities.<br>
<br>
For example, if current interest rates are 2% lower than your rate on a mortgage on which you have 3 years left to pay, it's going to matter much less than it would for someone who has 25 years of mortgage payments left.<br>
<br>
Because bonds with longer maturities have a greater level of risk due to changes in interest rates, they generally offer higher yields so they're more attractive to potential buyers. The relationship between maturity and yields is called the yield curve.<br>
<br>
Types of bonds<br>
<br>
Companies can issue bonds, but most bonds are issued by governments. Because governments are generally stable and can raise taxes if needed to cover debt payments, these bonds are typically higher-quality, although there are exceptions.<br>
