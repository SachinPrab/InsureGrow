         <h1><b><u><center>Fixed Deposits Explained</center></u></b></h1>
         <p><center>A fixed deposit (FD) is a type of savings account offered by banks and financial institutions where you deposit a lump sum of money for a fixed period of time and earn interest on it. It is also known as a term deposit or time deposit.<br>

Here are some important features of fixed deposits:<br>

Fixed tenure: Fixed deposits have a fixed tenure, which means you have to deposit your money for a predetermined period of time, which could range from a few days to several years.<br>

Interest rate: Fixed deposits offer a higher rate of interest than a regular savings account, and the interest rate is fixed for the entire tenure. The interest rate offered by banks and financial institutions varies based on the tenure of the fixed deposit and the amount deposited.<br>

Taxation: The interest earned on a fixed deposit is taxable as per the income tax laws in India. The bank will deduct TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on the interest earned, and you will have to pay tax on the interest earned based on your income tax slab.<br>

Premature withdrawal: You can withdraw your money from a fixed deposit before the maturity date, but you will have to pay a penalty for early withdrawal.<br>

FD renewal: You can renew your fixed deposit once it matures. You can either renew it for the same tenure or choose a different tenure.<br>

Deposit amount: The minimum deposit amount for a fixed deposit varies from bank to bank. Some banks allow you to open a fixed deposit account with a minimum deposit of Rs. 1,000, while others may require a higher amount.<br>

FD receipt: When you open a fixed deposit account, you will receive a fixed deposit receipt that contains the details of the deposit, including the deposit amount, the interest rate, the tenure, and the maturity date.<br>

Fixed deposits are a safe and secure investment option that provides a fixed rate of return. They are suitable for people who are looking for a low-risk investment option with a guaranteed return.<br>
