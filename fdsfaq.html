Yes. One of the benefits of FD is that you can take a loan against it. In case of a financial emergency, you can take a loan against your FD instead of breaking it before maturity. This will save you from losing interest on your fixed deposit. The banks can offer loans ranging from 60% to 90% of the deposited amount. You can even get a higher amount but with higher interest charges. The rate of interest on the loan against your FD amount is usually 2% to 2.5% higher than the rate of interest given on your fixed deposit. However, it is still less than what you will have to pay on a personal loan.<br>

9.What will happen to my money if I close my FD before maturity<br>
If you wish to close your fixed deposit account, your bank will pay you back the principal amount as well as the interest either at a lower rate of interest and/or after deducting a penalty.<br>

Lower rate of interest:<br>

In case of premature withdrawal, the interest on your FD will be paid not as per the original rate of interest but as per the rate applicable to the date of the deposit.<br>

For instance, you opened an FD account on 1 June 2013 for 4 years at 8%. Due to some reason, you want to close your fixed deposit account after one year on 1 June 2014. At the time of opening of your FD, the interest rate applicable for one year FD was 7.5%. So when you close the account, you will earn interest at 7.5% per annum on your deposits and not at the original rate of 8%.<br>
