So you have general liability insurance, professional liability insurance, worker’s compensation insurance, commercial auto, commercial umbrella, cyber insurance and more -- you think you are all set with a comprehensive business insurance policy.

But did you know if you are in a certain profession, you might need more than those business insurance policies?

I know it sounds crazy, right? But doing business for or providing services to another party can be complex, and sometimes it involves additional risk mitigation tools.

That’s where bonds come in.

What are bonds, you ask?

That’s where we come in. At Berry Insurance, our team is expert in the bond area, issuing hundreds to our clients per year, so we can walk you through it.

But bonds can be confusing, so buckle in and let’s dive into what you need to know.<br>

2.What is an insurance bond? Is it an insurance policy?<br>
Although they are generally lumped in the insurance category, bonds are actually not technically insurance.

Here is the difference between the two:

An insurance policy is an agreement between the insured (you) and the insurance company, whereby the company agrees to pay for certain claims in return for you paying a premium. 

A bond (also called surety bond) is an agreement between three parties - the principal (the person purchasing the bond), the obligee (the person who receives the benefit) and the insurance company.

An insurance bond is not meant to pay for claims. It is meant to provide a financial guarantee that the person or entity purchasing the bond (the principal) will reimburse the obligee should the principal default, fail to fulfill its obligations, or a claim is made.

In other words, an insurance bond is meant to prove or support the financial stability of the entity purchasing the bond. It affirms that the principal will be able to repay the bond company if it pays out a claim.

In most cases, when bonds are written, loss isn’t generally expected. They are intended to work as an extra layer of protection just in case the bond purchaser (the principal) is liable for not meeting the terms of any work-related agreements.<br>

3.What types of bonds are there?<br>
I warned you, bonds are pretty confusing, but let’s look at some examples of bonds to help you understand when and why they might be necessary.

There are many types of insurance bonds available, but the most common are public official bonds, license and permit bonds, fidelity bonds, and contract bonds.

A public official bond is designed to guarantee that you will faithfully perform the duties of your office (whether elected or appointed). Typically these are issued to persons responsible for handling money. 

Some common examples of public official bonds are:

Tax Collector
Treasurer/Assistant Treasurer
Town Clerk
Constable
Subordinate handling money
A contract bond is used to guarantee fulfillment of your construction contractual obligations.

Some common examples of contract bonds are:

Bid Bond: guarantees that if you are awarded a job, you will comply with the bid specs. (This bond typically does not cost you anything!)
Performance Bond: requires the contractor to finish a job on budget and on deadline. (usually combined with a Payment Bond)
Payment Bond: provides your subcontractors and vendors a guarantee that they will be paid for their work on the job.
A license and permit bond is used to satisfy the requirements of a government agency, such as your local city or town. 

Some common examples of license and permit bonds are:

Professional licensure bonds (i.e. real estate, insurance, etc.)
Mortgage broker or lender bonds
Notary bonds
Private investigator bonds
Auto dealer bonds
Street repair, drain laying, demolition or street opening permit bonds
Auctioneer bond
Collection agency bond
Travel agency bond
A fidelity bond can be used to protect your business from fraudulent acts committed by your employees. 

Some common examples of fidelity bonds are:

Employee theft/dishonesty bonds
Janitorial service bonds
ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) bonds
Probate or Executor bonds.<br>

3.How much does a bond cost?<br>
We wish we could give you a definitive answer here, but because all bonds are so different and priced based on various factors, it’s difficult to be specific.

The cost of a bond depends on many factors, including the type of bond needed, industry experience, the financial stability of the entity or employee being bonded, credit score, and more. 

Mostly however, it depends on the contract amount of the bond. Most bonds cost somewhere between .5% and 20% of the value of the bond.
